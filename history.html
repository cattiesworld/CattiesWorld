                <p class="text">
                    also, my "m" key is missing so that is why my message doesn't contain the letter "m". I'm sure this will trigger a lot of people, but i searched and couldn't find my 'm" key anyore. (how i wrote this? I anaged to copy paste the letter from soewhere.)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But now for the real story. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I thought, "hey, wouldn't it be fun to proote the gae a bit by putting a level on HW to show people y gae exists. So I did that, ade a siple level, and published it.
                    Little did I know that that wasn't a great idea. At least, for now. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, I went back to the gae, and noticed, that it actually did an insane job. Like the play counts were increasing drastically, and I just couldn't believe y eyes. 
                    I was happy, this was great! y gae finally gaining soe deserved attention! But when I was playing the gae yself, I noticed soething really annoying. The level browser
                    enu, randoly appeared when playing, and the reason for that was, each tie soeone would reload that little list, it would for soe dub reason update for everyone, regardless of what enu they were in. This has been a bug for so long, but it wasn't that bad since nobody really played the gae anyways, so that was fine. Kinda.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, i reloaded the page to see if the issue would persist, but... it still happened. This ade e feel a bit uncofortable, so i reloaded again, and saw it happen again.
                    Now, I knew THIS was bad, because a peranent enu randoly whilst gaeplay is really annoying, and I was sure everyone playing was dealing with it, which would be really bad for the reputation of the gae. So, i kinda panicked, and just wrote in the coents that i was fixing it. So I did, I tried to fix it, and, it seeed to be fixed! Finally, after so long! Fixed! So, I saved it to y coputer, packaged it using penguinod packager, changed the css to ake it look nicer, and ost iportantly, uploaded it to github.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, I was kind of relieved that I fixed it, but I was still a bit panicking because there were still people playing the levels and still adding to the playercount
                    which eant people were experiencing it still. (also i want to point out that I a currently suffering a headache :P. really growing on e so I just wanted to have said that now.) So, I waited, went back to the patched version to play it yself, but then, horror struck, because, I SUDDENLY GOT THE ENU AGAIN, so, i received a tiny heart attack, and panic, and anger, and irritation, and just slapped y own head really hard. Now, that was a bad idea, because, firstly, I a still feeling it, it hurts, and secondly, i probably got a light concussion because of it, but I was really angry, so I went back to the coents and say "hey uhh still on it" not quoted, but soething like that. Then, soeone actually joined the discord server, you should totally do that btw. And they pointed out the fucking GUI bug. So, I told the, yeah, I a fixing it right now, and so I was, I tried ultiple things, but just ended up copletely disconnecting the gae fro the server, like, that should do it right? (the bug was caused by other people loading the level list which updates everyones level list, regardless of the level list being open or not. The code is also expleely coplex so uh) So, I updated it once again, saved it to y coputer, packaged, it applied css, updated to github, wrote a horny ass coent, and waited. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I actually recorded that part, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TulQROIifi4">here</a>. But anyways, I yapped a bit, was kinda celebrating that I fixed it, and I was just happy because that annoying bug was finally fixed, and there's NO way, it could ever return. UNTIL... (see what I did here? Yeah I watched too uch ray willia johnson on yt hehe) I was just playing y own gae a bit but suddenly, I got backstabbed really, really hard. I bleeded all over the floor and was about to die. Is what it felt like. What really happened, was that the fucking shit, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a> suddenly APPEARED again, and it felt like, I was just not gonna ake it, so I just, kind of lost y sanity. But I wanted to do it in a fun way. So, I grabbed y phone, and started recording. I cally stood up, to cally close y door. I cally reoved the keyboard usb cable fro the back of y pc, and cally walked away with it to a wall. Then, I sacked that thing onto the floor, keys flying everywhere. Then, I saw that PHONE WAS SOEHOW OUT OF STORAGE, so it recorded all of that EXCEPT FOR THE KEYBOARD THROWING PART, so, it just stops at the part where I cally reoved the keyboard fro y coputer. Also, that is how I lost the letter "m" Now, that ade e rage even ore, so I threw that piece of shit called a phone, onto the carpet, but that wasn't satisfying enough, so I threw it again, still not satisfying enough. So I threw it really, really, hard, at the wooden floor. It span really crazy, and hit the corner of the phone, then it went flying to y crappy burned in aoled tv, which it then slowed down, launching the s pen out of it. Now, I expected this thing to be copletely destroyed, but, the cracks that already were in the screen, didn't change, actually, that whole thing was copletely unscaved, it only scratched the tv really bad. LAO. Still having that headache right now. But at that point. I just didn't know what to do. I just sat there, on the floor. Thinking what the fuck is going on. And then, I just got the idea to write a fucking story about it. Hell, why not!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oh yeah, and alsoâ€¦ the bug is still there, and I still want to jup off of a bridge /j    (/j eans it's a joke)
                    <br><br>
                    But the reason i took this so insanely serious, is, is because I've been working non stop on it since the last four onts. Sure, soeties i skipped a day or two, but really, only thing i was working on.

                <h2>SLIGHTLY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
                <p class="subtext">This story is based on allegations. Also, I might as well make a fun story out of it like Ray Williams, so read this as if it were his voice. If you don't know him, well... duck you.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    So, this is kind of diabolic. There was this person, let's call him gaey. He thought he could have some fun, and he went to a project someone made, <a href="https://snowshare.online/">Snowshare</a> (A project someone made that allows you to share video's, like YouTube),
                    There, he sended some... let's call it spicy stuff. But the creator of this project, they didn't like that so they implemented a way to
                    make the server safer and prevent this guy from sending these weird things. Now the thing is, since he got nowhere to send his weird links, we went searching for another site,
                    this site. He played it a little and quickly got bored. But then, he noticed an upload button. So he uploaded something, and it was a test. Later, he thought, wait, I can abuse this!
                    So he goes on and he decompresses the leveldata, and replaces the thumbnail image with something you probably already know. Then, he uploaded this level, and it got stored on the server. Then he probably
                    sent a couple dozen of requests to make it crash later. Then, the owner of this site wakes up, me. And then I see, hey, the server has crashed so I boot it up again.
                    Then I obviously had to remove those levels. <br><br> Then, he started posting weird things in the chat, which, I am just not gonna go over. This kept going and someone on my discord noticed and let
                    me know. Now I couldn't use my computer so I tried removing that content from my phone, all of the comments are stored in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BNHQhWUE5ObVXMYWz0ro2jKKMj9GNw_OQe6rsfZ4veY/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>, so i tried removing
                    it on my phone, and it didn't work. Turns out spreadsheets on phone is just a hot mess. But eventually I got it removed but it later came back. It turns out the attacked unpackaged
                    the code of the comments section and just started spamming his shady stuff. Now he  I had to entirely remove the google apps script to make it stop. Then, he started spamming the following and I quote(censored though): "Duck you for hacking showshare". Now, I did some research and found 
                    the project they talked about. I never knew about it before, so I got curious about what happened. I started arguing with one of the members of the server, (and I am sincerely sorry for that), claiming
                    it was one of them doing it. Now the thing is, this attacker actually isn't one of these people. This attacker actually pretended to be the creator of snowshare, just to create controversy ig?
                    <br><br>
                    anyways, later, when I put it back, he immediately kept going again.
                    I sent an ðŸ˜¡angryðŸ˜¡ formal message in the chat and he actually kinda responded, but obviously, as always, with his weird corn addiction at the end of the message, and obviously spammed.
                    Now I said come and talk in dc if you really want to, but he refused, like what does bro want? Anyways, I removed the apps script once again, and he didn't come back since. Now, this happened today, like 4 hours ago. 
                    So there's a solid chance he might return, and when he does, I have a fun little surprise for him.

                    But the moral of the story is, make sure your site is well protected. Because people tend to want to break it. lol.

                    <p class="text">
                    Hi, The game developer, Greedy Allay here. So I've noticed some slight vulnerabilities in the site. Some people have apparently found a way to ruin someone's day for no reason. Firstly, someone on discord, I will just ducking snitch on this person because they deserve it. This person, that names themselfes <a href="images/gyat.png">jwklong</a> (shame on him, I told him he had no permission to do so), tried decompiling the game. Now I am all for modding, I'd say go ahead, but ONLY if you are going to make a seriously
                    cool or funny mod. Like you can just ask me for the source code and I will probably say no because I don't know you, but let's say I would know you, you could just create a mod and I could even host that mod on my site lol. But that's not the point. 
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The real problem is is that some degenerate(s) are posting inappropriate stuff in the chatroom and once even in the levels. Now they would have had to decompile the leveldata, and source code, which, come on man why are you wasting your time doing this only to break stuff you know?
                    <br><br>
                    I cannot stress this enough, but please, please just watch out with the comments, because there might be objectively bad people that will post inappropriate stuff on there.
                    Now I wanted to add a system where u have moderator approval, which is not hard to do, but come on, man, where has humanity gone.
    
                    Now the comments, by some miracle broke today, which saved anyone that visits from seeing what the frick these weird people sent. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, developing this game has taken me at least a couple hundreds of hours. I work on this on an almost daily basis and I used to only do this the entire day. Now THAT is probably not very healthy, but the worst part is is that
                    there are individuals that are just too dumb to understand how difficult it actually is to make a functioning game, having a functioning backend, and a functioning comment system and that stuff.
                    THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, and they never will. Sadly, humanity has gone in a direction that you're better of protecting everything as much as possible because
                    it <b>WILL</b> get vandalised, sadly. Just like in real life.
    
                    <br><br>
                    Now, to all the people that probably weren't planning on doing anything weird are probably also the only ones that are ever going to read this, but I just wanted to let this know. Please be careful on the
                    site as it... it's just not entirely safe yet, and you might be exposed to stuff that is just not so family friendly.

                <div class="news"><p class="big">News</p><br><p class="text">
                    Hello! Welcome to my little website! I have been spending the last couple of weeks working on this game, and I've got to say, it is turning out pretty well.
                    Sure, it still has a ton of annoying bugs, and the editor might still be very limited, but I think we're up to a good start. As of writing, we are at version 
                    <a href="Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.98.html">v0.98 alpha.</a> <br><br>
                    Now, I am not expecting my game to be the next big thing. This is more like a passion project for me, and, maybe I should be focusing more on school, but this 
                    is way more fun. I can be creative, and make my own stuff whereas in school you just need to listen to some boring explanation from your teacher about mitosis
                    (i still don't know how that works.) Also, I really regret choosing for Biology and Chemistry. I though, yay! Interesting! And from Chemistry I expected to be doing
                    actual physical experiments. But we never did that and only really learned theory with a teacher that has the worst humour ever. Now, I think I am getting sidetracked here,
                    so back to the actual subject. Here are a couple of bugs that annoy be a ton and for some weird reason, seem impossible to fix, since my code looks totally fine:
                    <br>- When clicking a menu button, it has a random chance, (around 50%) to ignore your press.
                    <br>- When clicking on a level in the level browser, it often fails to load, which keeps making me furious every time it happens lol<br><br>
                    Now, hosting this is pretty simple. I made a backend that serves the stages and allows you to upload stages. The device in question, is a cheap OPPO A53 that works
                    terrible for normal day use but works perfectly for this type of shenanigans. The backend consists of three arrays, one is for the level data, one is for the IDs of
                    the levels, this is used to determine what level needs to be loaded and eliminates loading the wrong level if duplicate names are present. And there's a list that keeps
                    track of the view count of every stage. The extension I am using is called CloudLink, which really made my life easier. If I were to use the built in scratch variables,
                    that would be absolute hell.
                    Pretty simple. Took the entire weekend to build. Not important. <br><br> I don't think anyone is ever gonna read this, except for me maybe,
                    in ten years. Message to self in future: if you want to host it again, the server files are on your Google Drive. Now, I think this is getting a little long.
                    I will try to host the server as long as possible, or until I stop developing it and nobody plays it. But at the time of writing, nobody has played this yet, besides some people
                    I know. My tactic of getting this game a little bit of attention would be literally going door to door and putting little ads for my game in people's mailbox. I think that is not illegal.
                    And secondly, I will create a video on my main YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Greedy-Allay">Greedy Allay</a>, that will be very detailed in the development of the game
                    and do normal playthroughs on my other channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@masterryflex146">Masterryflex</a>. I will also post huge updates on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@minestreem-official">Minestreem</a>.
                    wow i cant believe anyone has read this. The chance is so smoll because there will not be a huge amount of people on this website, and only a fraction will read this and a fraction
                    of that will read it all the way through. Also, below are some links to older versions and lighter ones in case you are on a really low end device. Keep in mind that in some versions
                    the gore cannot be turned off.<p class="subtext">Feb 20 2025</p>
