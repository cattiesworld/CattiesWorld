                <h2>PERFORMANCE UPDATE?!</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    As what was probably already clear, the game's performance is an absolute dumpster fire. I've always been bugged by how bad the performance was and how it got worse with every single update.
                    Most people, weren't able to play the game normally, unless very advanced hardware was used. Think of it as an S24, or a R5 5600x. That's what I used, and it used to be the only hardware it worked
                    well on. <br><br> Well, that is no more, since I actually found the culprit to the immense lag. <br> See, Cattie's World, is created in a heavily modified version of Scratch, called Penguinmod.
                    <a href="https://penguinmod.com">Penguinmod</a> is a slightly modified version of <a href="https://turbowarp.org">Turbowarp</a>, which mostly exists because it adds project sharing. But they both add tons of blocks (penguinmod adds a little more and has a bigger community) and allows for custom extensions, like a physics engine. However, these blocks are not created by the actual creators of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>,
                    which means they won't be as stable as the vanilla Scratch blocks. <br><br>
                    But, you might be asking, "hey, what was causing that lag then?" "Why are you wasting my time and not just telling me right away?" "What's wrong with you, you bastard!" Now, in all honesty, nobody said that
                    but the reason for that is, is that I need to fill this in enough for it to feel like a proper message to you. <br>
                    But onto the question, what was causing the lag?
                    <br><br>
                    Now, you might not know, but I've actually tried to optimise the game several times, without success. I tried removing all sprites, the "When i start as a clone" code, and more. But to my
                    surprise, none of that shit did nothing. Well, it turns out that the people behind Turbowarp did a real dirty job at creating a specific block, the "When <boolean>" block. Now, this block on it's own,
                        there's nothing wrong with it. But when used in high capacity, for instance, in levels with several clones that contain multiple of those blocks, it gets really laggy. <br><br>
                        So, I was once again, trying to optimise the game. I came across the when block, and deleted it. I was just trying to see what would happen if I deleted more blocks that caused script activation.
                        But when I tried the game, to my absolute surpise, all of the lag was gone. Sure, there was still a bit of lag, but it went from 28 to 60 (i was testing it in a worst-case-scenario level) I was
                        very happy, and still a bit skeptical tho.
                        <br>I replace the when blocks for forever loops, and wow! It runs totally fine! Even on the most intensive levels. Someone reported that they went from 20 - 30 fps to 50 fps! On a second gen i5!
                        <br>So, what's the moral of the story?

                <br><a href="Pre-Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.54.html">CattiesWorldV0.54 (no gore, only cat skin)</a><br>runs on LITERALLY everything, except for a €40 mp4 player with android (it does run but you can't play)
                <br><a href="Pre-Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.76.html">CattiesWorldV0.76 (early on gore, only cat skin)</a><br>more modern, level browser does not work in this version anymore for some reason, and some older gore. Still looks good, though, only no decals sadly :(<br>
                <a href="Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.98.html">CattiesWorldV0.98 (most modern old version, no themes)</a><br>
                This version is the most stable and works well with online levels and older computers. Might not have all the bells and whistles the normal game has, but it is functional. And smaller in file size.

                Modding totally allowed, all for it. But your mod needs to have added a big change, or be anything serious. If you want to mod this game, you can dm me on discord (greedyallay) for the project file,
                and you can submit your mod to me and if it's good, I'll add it to the showcase!
                <br>Hosting mods on your own site is allowed, ONLY if it changes enough about the game (e.g. it adds a new character, vehicle, or has modified versions of the characters, make it yours!)</p>
