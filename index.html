                <h2>I just got extremely aggressive and went mentally insane.</h2>
                <!-- <p class="subtext">This story is based on allegations. Also, I might as well make a fun story out of it like Ray Williams, so read this as if it were his voice. If you don't know him, well... duck you.</p> -->
                <p class="text">
                    also, my "m" key is missing so that is why my message doesn't contain the letter "m". I'm sure this will trigger a lot of people, but i searched and couldn't find my 'm" key anyore. (how i wrote this? I anaged to copy paste the letter from soewhere.)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But now for the real story. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I thought, "hey, wouldn't it be fun to proote the gae a bit by putting a level on HW to show people y gae exists. So I did that, ade a siple level, and published it.
                    Little did I know that that wasn't a great idea. At least, for now. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, I went back to the gae, and noticed, that it actually did an insane job. Like the play counts were increasing drastically, and I just couldn't believe y eyes. 
                    I was happy, this was great! y gae finally gaining soe deserved attention! But when I was playing the gae yself, I noticed soething really annoying. The level browser
                    enu, randoly appeared when playing, and the reason for that was, each tie soeone would reload that little list, it would for soe dub reason update for everyone, regardless of what enu they were in. This has been a bug for so long, but it wasn't that bad since nobody really played the gae anyways, so that was fine. Kinda.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, i reloaded the page to see if the issue would persist, but... it still happened. This ade e feel a bit uncofortable, so i reloaded again, and saw it happen again.
                    Now, I knew THIS was bad, because a peranent enu randoly whilst gaeplay is really annoying, and I was sure everyone playing was dealing with it, which would be really bad for the reputation of the gae. So, i kinda panicked, and just wrote in the coents that i was fixing it. So I did, I tried to fix it, and, it seeed to be fixed! Finally, after so long! Fixed! So, I saved it to y coputer, packaged it using penguinod packager, changed the css to ake it look nicer, and ost iportantly, uploaded it to github.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, I was kind of relieved that I fixed it, but I was still a bit panicking because there were still people playing the levels and still adding to the playercount
                    which eant people were experiencing it still. (also i want to point out that I a currently suffering a headache :P. really growing on e so I just wanted to have said that now.) So, I waited, went back to the patched version to play it yself, but then, horror struck, because, I SUDDENLY GOT THE ENU AGAIN, so, i received a tiny heart attack, and panic, and anger, and irritation, and just slapped y own head really hard. Now, that was a bad idea, because, firstly, I a still feeling it, it hurts, and secondly, i probably got a light concussion because of it, but I was really angry, so I went back to the coents and say "hey uhh still on it" not quoted, but soething like that. Then, soeone actually joined the discord server, you should totally do that btw. And they pointed out the fucking GUI bug. So, I told the, yeah, I a fixing it right now, and so I was, I tried ultiple things, but just ended up copletely disconnecting the gae fro the server, like, that should do it right? (the bug was caused by other people loading the level list which updates everyones level list, regardless of the level list being open or not. The code is also expleely coplex so uh) So, I updated it once again, saved it to y coputer, packaged, it applied css, updated to github, wrote a horny ass coent, and waited. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I actually recorded that part, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TulQROIifi4">here</a>. But anyways, I yapped a bit, was kinda celebrating that I fixed it, and I was just happy because that annoying bug was finally fixed, and there's NO way, it could ever return. UNTIL... (see what I did here? Yeah I watched too uch ray willia johnson on yt hehe) I was just playing y own gae a bit but suddenly, I got backstabbed really, really hard. I bleeded all over the floor and was about to die. Is what it felt like. What really happened, was that the fucking shit, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a> suddenly APPEARED again, and it felt like, I was just not gonna ake it, so I just, kind of lost y sanity. But I wanted to do it in a fun way. So, I grabbed y phone, and started recording. I cally stood up, to cally close y door. I cally reoved the keyboard usb cable fro the back of y pc, and cally walked away with it to a wall. Then, I sacked that thing onto the floor, keys flying everywhere. Then, I saw that PHONE WAS SOEHOW OUT OF STORAGE, so it recorded all of that EXCEPT FOR THE KEYBOARD THROWING PART, so, it just stops at the part where I cally reoved the keyboard fro y coputer. Also, that is how I lost the letter "m" Now, that ade e rage even ore, so I threw that piece of shit called a phone, onto the carpet, but that wasn't satisfying enough, so I threw it again, still not satisfying enough. So I threw it really, really, hard, at the wooden floor. It span really crazy, and hit the corner of the phone, then it went flying to y crappy burned in aoled tv, which it then slowed down, launching the s pen out of it. Now, I expected this thing to be copletely destroyed, but, the cracks that already were in the screen, didn't change, actually, that whole thing was copletely unscaved, it only scratched the tv really bad. LAO. Still having that headache right now. But at that point. I just didn't know what to do. I just sat there, on the floor. Thinking what the fuck is going on. And then, I just got the idea to write a fucking story about it. Hell, why not!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oh yeah, and also… the bug is still there, and I still want to jup off of a bridge /j    (/j eans it's a joke)
                    <br><br>
                    But the reason i took this so insanely serious, is, is because I've been working non stop on it since the last four onts. Sure, soeties i skipped a day or two, but really, only thing i was working on.

                for some reason i feel like the physics in this version feel nicer
                <br><a href="Pre-Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.54.html">CattiesWorldV0.54 (no gore, only cat skin)</a><br>runs on LITERALLY everything, except for a €40 mp4 player with android (it does run but you can't play)
                <br><a href="Pre-Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.76.html">CattiesWorldV0.76 (early on gore, only cat skin)</a><br>more modern, level browser does not work in this version anymore for some reason, and some older gore. Still looks good, though, only no decals sadly :(<br>
                <a href="Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.98.html">CattiesWorldV0.98 (most modern old version, no themes)</a><br>
                This version is the most stable and works well with online levels and older computers. Might not have all the bells and whistles the normal game has, but it is functional. And smaller in file size.
                <p class="boldtext">Here some older versions:</p>

                I am for modding, but your mod needs to have added a big change, or be anything serious. If you want to mod this game, you can dm me on discord (greedyallay) for the project file,
                and you can submit your mod to me and if it's good, I'll add it to the showcase!
                <br>Hosting mods on your own site is allowed, ONLY if it changes enough about the game (e.g. it adds a new character, vehicle, or has modified versions of the characters, make it yours!)
