                <h2>SLIGHTLY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
                <p class="subtext">This story is based on allegations. Also, I might as well make a fun story out of it like Ray Williams, so read this as if it were his voice. If you don't know him, well... duck you.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    So, this is kind of diabolic. There was this person, let's call him gaey. He thought he could have some fun, and he went to a project someone made, <a href="https://snowshare.online/">Snowshare</a> (A project someone made that allows you to share video's, like YouTube),
                    There, he sended some... let's call it spicy stuff. But the creator of this project, they didn't like that so they implemented a way to
                    make the server safer and prevent this guy from sending these weird things. Now the thing is, since he got nowhere to send his weird links, we went searching for another site,
                    this site. He played it a little and quickly got bored. But then, he noticed an upload button. So he uploaded something, and it was a test. Later, he thought, wait, I can abuse this!
                    So he goes on and he decompresses the leveldata, and replaces the thumbnail image with something you probably already know. Then, he uploaded this level, and it got stored on the server. Then he probably
                    sent a couple dozen of requests to make it crash later. Then, the owner of this site wakes up, me. And then I see, hey, the server has crashed so I boot it up again.
                    Then I obviously had to remove those levels. <br><br> Then, he started posting weird things in the chat, which, I am just not gonna go over. This kept going and someone on my discord noticed and let
                    me know. Now I couldn't use my computer so I tried removing that content from my phone, all of the comments are stored in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BNHQhWUE5ObVXMYWz0ro2jKKMj9GNw_OQe6rsfZ4veY/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>, so i tried removing
                    it on my phone, and it didn't work. Turns out spreadsheets on phone is just a hot mess. But eventually I got it removed but it later came back. It turns out the attacked unpackaged
                    the code of the comments section and just started spamming his shady stuff. Now he  I had to entirely remove the google apps script to make it stop. Then, he started spamming the following and I quote(censored though): "Duck you for hacking showshare". Now, I did some research and found 
                    the project they talked about. I never knew about it before, so I got curious about what happened. I started arguing with one of the members of the server, (and I am sincerely sorry for that), claiming
                    it was one of them doing it. Now the thing is, this attacker actually isn't one of these people. This attacker actually pretended to be the creator of snowshare, just to create controversy ig?
                    <br><br>
                    anyways, later, when I put it back, he immediately kept going again.
                    I sent an ðŸ˜¡angryðŸ˜¡ formal message in the chat and he actually kinda responded, but obviously, as always, with his weird corn addiction at the end of the message, and obviously spammed.
                    Now I said come and talk in dc if you really want to, but he refused, like what does bro want? Anyways, I removed the apps script once again, and he didn't come back since. Now, this happened today, like 4 hours ago. 
                    So there's a solid chance he might return, and when he does, I have a fun little surprise for him.

                    But the moral of the story is, make sure your site is well protected. Because people tend to want to break it. lol.

                for some reason i feel like the physics in this version feel nicer
                <br><a href="Pre-Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.54.html">CattiesWorldV0.54 (no gore, only cat skin)</a><br>runs on LITERALLY everything, except for a â‚¬40 mp4 player with android (it does run but you can't play)
                <br><a href="Pre-Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.76.html">CattiesWorldV0.76 (early on gore, only cat skin)</a><br>more modern, level browser does not work in this version anymore for some reason, and some older gore. Still looks good, though, only no decals sadly :(<br>
                <a href="Alpha/CattiesWorldV0.98.html">CattiesWorldV0.98 (most modern old version, no themes)</a><br>
                This version is the most stable and works well with online levels and older computers. Might not have all the bells and whistles the normal game has, but it is functional. And smaller in file size.
                <p class="boldtext">Here some older versions:</p>
